# By default, the LoginManager uses flash to display messages when a
# user is required to log in. These messages are in English. If you
# require localization, set the localize_callback attribute of
# LoginManager to a function to be called with these messages before
# theyâ€™re sent to flash, e.g. gettext. This function will be called
# with the message and its return value will be sent to flash instead.
